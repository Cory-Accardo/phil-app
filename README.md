# phil-app
A fun side project I made in a few hours. Inspired by literature on free will and determinism.
Uses only native browser apis, javascript, and basic trigonometry.

The central question is whether or not determinism can exist in a universe where truly random events exist.

There are two kinds of balls that a user can create:

determined balls: where the initial speed and direction is determined by the user

quantum balls: where the initial speed and direction is sourced from a quantum random number generator https://qrng.anu.edu.au/contact/api-documentation/

Because the balls can interact (bounce off of each other), even a deterministic ball is inevitably corrupted by randomness (a qauntum ball). This means, that in any system, a single truly random event inevitably leads to a random system.

How can determinism exist in a random system? That's up for you to ponder.
